<strong>Project Title:</strong> Google Search Front-End

<strong>Description:</strong>

I designed a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. This project involved creating HTML forms that interface with Google’s search functionalities by sending GET parameters through the URL. The objective was to replicate Google’s search experience with a user-friendly interface, including search bars and advanced search options, while incorporating HTML and CSS to achieve a clean and functional design.

<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> For structuring the pages and forms.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> For styling the search pages to match Google’s aesthetics.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript (optional):</strong> For adding interactive features if needed.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Features:</strong>

<strong>Google Search Page (index.html):</strong>

<ul>
  <li>I created a search page that allows users to type in a query and perform a Google search. The search bar and button were centered with rounded corners to mimic Google’s design.</li>
  <li>Added links in the upper-right corner to navigate to the Google Image Search and Google Advanced Search pages.</li>
  <li>An “I’m Feeling Lucky” button was included, which redirects users to the first Google search result directly.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Google Image Search Page (images.html):</strong>

<ul>
  <li>I designed a page for Google Image Search, where users can enter a query and be redirected to Google Image Search results.</li>
  <li>This page includes a link in the upper-right corner to return to the main Google Search page.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Google Advanced Search Page:</strong>

<ul>
  <li>I implemented a page that allows users to perform advanced searches by entering specific criteria into four fields.</li>
  <li>The fields correspond to Google’s advanced search options and are stacked vertically with labels aligned to the left.</li>
  <li>The “Advanced Search” button was styled to be blue with white text, as per Google’s design.</li>
</ul>
<strong>CSS Styling (styles.css):</strong>

<ul>
  <li>I styled the pages to resemble Google’s clean and minimalistic design. This included centering the search bar, styling the buttons, and ensuring that the layout was consistent across different pages.</li>
</ul>
